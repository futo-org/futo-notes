# Store Submission Reference — Native iOS & Android

Console-ready answers for the App Store and Google Play submission forms, plus
the review-notes copy. This reflects FUTO Notes' actual data behavior:

- **No FUTO-hosted cloud.** Sync is **opt-in** and connects to a **server the
  user self-hosts** (futo-notes-server). The user enters the server URL; the
  app only *logs in* (`/api/auth/password/login`) — there is **no in-app account
  creation**.
- **E2EE.** Note content is encrypted on-device (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 +
  AES-256-GCM) before upload; the server stores opaque blobs.
- **The only data FUTO itself receives** is **optional crash diagnostics** sent
  to `notes-crashlog.futo.org` (default on, opt-out in Settings).
- Notes live locally in the app's Documents container. No ads, no analytics, no
  tracking, no third-party data-collection SDKs.

> ⚠️ These answers rest on the self-hosted, no-FUTO-cloud model above. If FUTO
> ever ships a hosted sync service, revisit account-deletion (Apple 5.1.1(v) /
> Play account-deletion policy) and the data-collection declarations.

## Apple App Store

### App Privacy (App Store Connect → App Privacy)

**Data collected by the developer:**

| Data type | Linked to identity | Used for tracking | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Diagnostics → **Crash Data** | No | No | App Functionality |
| Diagnostics → **Other Diagnostic Data** (device model, OS version, session id) | No | No | App Functionality |

Everything else → **Data Not Collected**, because:
- Note content and login email/password are transmitted **only to the user's
  own self-hosted server**, end-to-end encrypted; FUTO neither receives nor
  stores them. They are not "collected by the developer."
- No identifiers, usage data, location, contacts, or purchases are gathered.

Mirror this in `Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` (already committed): crash +
other-diagnostic data, not linked, not tracking; required-reason APIs declared
(UserDefaults `CA92.1`, file-timestamp `C617.1`, disk-space `E174.1`).

### Export compliance

`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` is set in `project.yml`. Basis: the app
uses only **standard** cryptography (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2, TLS) and qualifies for
the exemption under category 5D992.c.

> ✅ **Confirm before first submission:** verify with FUTO's compliance owner
> that no annual self-classification report / ERN to the U.S. BIS is required
> for the E2EE feature. If one is, the answer stays "uses exemption" but you
> must file the report.

### App Review notes (paste into "Notes" for the reviewer)

```
FUTO Notes is an offline-first Markdown notes app. All features work fully
offline with no account.

Sync is OPTIONAL and end-to-end encrypted. There is NO FUTO-operated cloud
service: sync connects to a server the user hosts themselves (futo-notes-server,
open source). The app only logs in to a user-provided server URL — it does not
create accounts.

Because there is no developer-operated account service, account/data deletion is
handled by the user on their own server. In-app, Settings → Full reset erases
all local notes and disconnects sync.

To review sync (optional): we can provide a temporary test server URL +
credentials on request. Otherwise the app is fully functional offline without
signing in.
```

### Other listing requirements
- Privacy policy URL (required) — see "Privacy policy" below.
- Screenshots per required device sizes; app icon already in the asset catalog
  (alpha removed).

## Google Play

### Data safety form

- **Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types?** → Yes
  (crash diagnostics only).
- **Data collected:**
  - **App activity / Diagnostics → Crash logs** — Collected, **not** shared,
    processed off-device (sent to `notes-crashlog.futo.org`). Optional
    (user can opt out in Settings). Not linked to a user identity.
  - **Diagnostics → Other** (device model, OS, session id) — same treatment.
- **Data NOT collected by the developer:** note content, email, files — these go
  only to the user's self-hosted server, E2EE; FUTO does not receive them.
- **Is all data encrypted in transit?** → Yes (HTTPS; note content additionally
  E2EE before upload).
- **Do you provide a way for users to request data deletion?** → Yes. Explain:
  in-app *Settings → Full reset* deletes all local data; sync data lives on the
  user's own self-hosted server which the user controls/deletes directly. FUTO
  operates no account service. Crash diagnostics are anonymous and not tied to a
  user account.

### Account deletion policy

The app does **not** offer in-app account creation (sync is login-only to a
self-hosted server), so the in-app-delete / deletion-URL requirement does not
apply to a FUTO-operated account. Document the self-hosted model in the store
listing and the Data Safety form as above. If Play review pushes back, the
fallback is a public deletion-request page (see Privacy policy host).

### Other listing requirements
- Privacy policy URL (required).
- 512×512 app icon + 1024×500 feature graphic + phone screenshots (console
  uploads, not in the repo).
- Target API 35 ✓ (set in `build.gradle.kts`).
- Upload an **AAB** (`./gradlew :app:bundleRelease`), not an APK.

### CI/CD publishing (automated)

A tag pipeline now builds and uploads the AAB to the Google Play **internal
testing** track automatically, using FUTO's shared `publish_playstore.py`
uploader (the same one grayjay uses — Android Publisher API v3 with a resumable
chunked upload, transient-error retry, and staged-rollout support):

- `build:android-native` builds a signed APK **and** AAB on tags.
- `release:gate` blocks the release if any test job (or artifact) is missing.
- `publish:android` (gated by `release:gate`) builds the
  `google-api-python-client` venv (`scripts/venv-playstore.sh`) and runs
  `scripts/publish_playstore.py --package com.futo.notes --aab <…> --track
  internal --status completed`. It consumes the prebuilt AAB — no Rust rebuild.

To go live later, change the `--track internal` flag in the `publish:android`
job to `--track production` (optionally `--status inProgress --rollout 0.1`
for a staged rollout). Keep early releases on `internal`.

**One-time setup required before the first tag pipeline can publish:**

1. **Create the app in Play Console** (`com.futo.notes`) and complete the
   content declarations (Data Safety, content rating, target audience). The
   Play API cannot create the app listing — only upload releases to it.
2. **Enroll in Play App Signing** (default on first upload). Your existing
   `futo-notes-release.keystore` is the **upload key**.
3. **Create a Google Cloud service account** with the Play Android Publisher
   API enabled, then in Play Console → *Users & permissions* grant it
   **"Release to testing tracks"** (or admin). Download its JSON key.
4. **Set these GitLab CI/CD variables** (masked + protected):
   - `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` — base64 of the service-account JSON
     (`base64 -i service-account.json | pbcopy`)
   - `KEYSTORE_BASE64` — base64 of `futo-notes-release.keystore`
   - `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` — the keystore password
   - `KEY_ALIAS` — the signing key alias

Without `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` the `publish:android` job fails fast;
without the `KEYSTORE_*` vars the AAB is unsigned and Play rejects it.

> First release only: even after the AAB lands on the internal track via the
> API, testers won't see it until the Console declarations above are complete.

## Privacy policy (host at a public URL; link from both stores)

Suggested content outline:

```
FUTO Notes — Privacy Policy

FUTO Notes is offline-first. Your notes are stored on your device.

Sync (optional): If you enable sync, your notes are end-to-end encrypted on your
device and uploaded to a server YOU host and control. FUTO does not operate a
notes server and does not receive or store your notes, email, or password.
Deleting your data: erase local data via Settings → Full reset; delete synced
data on your own server.

Crash reports (optional, on by default, disable in Settings): if a crash occurs,
the app may send a diagnostic report (error, stack trace, app version, device
model, OS version, a random session id, and any note you choose to add) to
notes-crashlog.futo.org to help us fix bugs. These reports are not linked to
your identity and are not used for tracking or advertising.

We do not use analytics, advertising, or third-party tracking.

Contact: <email/URL for data questions or deletion requests>
```

> Fill in the contact line and host this page (e.g. on notes.futo.org). Both
> stores reject submissions without a reachable privacy-policy URL.
