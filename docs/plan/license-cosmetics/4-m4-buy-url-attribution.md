## 4. M4 — attribution on the Buy URL

`buy_url(config, platform)` becomes `buy_url(config, platform, source)` with

```rust
pub enum BuySource { LicenseCard, AppIconPicker }
```

serialised as `&from=license-card` / `&from=app-icon`, after the existing `platform`. Every
caller names its source; there is no default. `license_links` grows a `source` parameter;
the desktop command and both shells pass it.

- It rides the click the user already makes: no new request, nothing stored, nothing sent
  without a tap. State this in the spec next to the zero-background-network principle.
- The deployed server does not record `platform` yet (license.md Gap). **Before M4 lands**,
  confirm with the FUTOpay/lib-polar owner which query parameters `checkout-ready` forwards
  into Polar order metadata and under what names, and write the answer into the Gap. If
  `from` is dropped on the floor, M4 is still correct and still cheap, but the Gap says so.
- Tests: the two URLs are exact-string tested per source and per environment; the contract
  test `the_buy_url_carries_the_platform` grows a sibling for `from`.

Verification: `cargo test -p futo-notes-license -p futo-notes-ffi`; open each Buy on a dev
build and read the URL in the browser's address bar.
