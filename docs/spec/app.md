# App — Cross-Cutting Spec

Behaviors and constraints that hold across every surface and platform.

## Render lifecycle

- The UI shell renders immediately. **Never gate first render on filesystem
  I/O.** Theme, prefs, notes, and the search index load in the background and
  apply reactively. → CLAUDE.md "Key Constraints"; `App.svelte` flips
  `initialized` synchronously.
- `plugin-fs` reads (`readTextFile`, `exists`) can hang indefinitely on a cold
  sandbox — never `await` one before first render. _(desktop Tauri; originally
  observed on the since-removed iOS Tauri shell — the native iOS app doesn't
  use `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs` at all)_

## Notes & files

- **The filename IS the title.** `"grocery list.md"` → title `"grocery list"`.
  No case changes, no dash→space, no transformations; only filesystem-breaking
  characters are stripped. → `sanitizeTitle`
- Notes are plain Markdown files on disk — "file over app." A note's content is
  its file's bytes; renaming a note renames its file.
- Renaming a note whose new title collides with another note suffixes the id
  (`Title` → `Title-2`, `-3`, …). A **case-only or Unicode-normalization-only**
  rename (`note`→`Note`, composed↔decomposed `café`) keeps the requested form
  and never bumps to `-2`, even on case/normalization-insensitive filesystems
  (APFS, NTFS). → `futo_notes_store::paths::unique_note_id`,
  `futo-notes-model` `rename_note`
- A note may embed images (`![](image-…)`); those image files are first-class
  vault content, not just notes. Anything that walks "the vault" for sync or
  integrity must include image blobs, not only `.md` — an image that a note
  references but that doesn't travel with it is a data-integrity bug (it leaves
  a broken `![]()` on every other device). → [sync.md](sync.md) "Embedded
  images sync with their notes"

## Vault location & file-manager access

- The vault should be reachable from the OS file browser so users can open, back
  up, and inter-operate with their notes ("file over app"). The Rust core does
  direct `std::fs` path I/O, so SAF / content-URIs are not viable — a
  user-visible vault must be a real filesystem path.
- **Desktop:** the vault is a normal folder (`~/Documents/futo-notes`), always
  browsable; changeable in Settings. Rust resolves the active/default folder
  only through `vault_location.rs`; debug builds retain the separate
  `~/Documents/fake-notes` root. → [desktop-rust.md](desktop-rust.md) "Vault
  and desktop safety boundaries"
- **iOS:** the vault lives in the app's Documents container
  (`Documents/futo-notes`) and is exposed in the Files app under
  "On My iPhone → FUTO Notes" via `UIFileSharingEnabled` +
  `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace`. Sync state / crash logs are dotfiles
  inside the vault, which the Files app hides. Applies to all installs (it only
  reveals the existing folder — no migration). _(iOS)_
- **Android:** storage is chosen on first run (Obsidian-style picker) and is
  switchable later in Settings → Storage. On Android 11+ the picker offers two
  modes and Device storage is the pre-selected recommended default; on API < 30
  it offers only App storage because Device storage depends on All-files access:
  - **Device storage** — `Documents/FUTO Notes` on shared storage: visible in
    the stock Files app + survives uninstall. Needs the "All files access"
    (`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`) permission, requested behind a rationale screen
    shown before the system dialog. Android 11+ only.
  - **App storage** — `Android/data/<pkg>/files/futo-notes`: no permission, but
    invisible to the stock Files app on Android 11+ and deleted on uninstall.
    Switching modes migrates the whole vault (including the `.futo` sync state)
    and relaunches. The switch blocks editor/store writes and pauses live sync;
    it stages the copy, verifies every relative path and file digest, and durably
    commits the new mode before deleting the source. A failed copy/verification
    or preference write keeps the old mode/root active and reports the failure.
    An open editor's pending draft must first produce a committed mutation or
    already match the bytes on disk; a skipped/missing/divergent flush aborts the
    switch instead of relaunching with an older draft. A non-empty destination is
    accepted only when its complete manifest already matches the source, so an
    unrelated pre-existing vault is never overwritten or cleaned up. An existing
    empty source directory is a valid switch, but a missing or non-directory
    active root is a failure (never interpreted as an empty vault). The move is
    transparent to sync because the object map is keyed by relative filename. →
    [sync.md](sync.md), `NotesStorage.kt`, `MainActivity.performSwitch`,
    `NotesStorageTest`
- **No silent relocation of existing installs.** An Android install that predates
  the picker is grandfathered on its legacy internal location
  (`filesDir/futo-notes`); it gains Files-app access only by opting in via
  Settings (which migrates). An update must never repoint an existing vault out
  from under the user.
- **Dev/prod guard for Device storage:** the public Documents folder is not
  package-scoped, so debug builds use `Documents/FUTO Notes Dev` while release
  uses `Documents/FUTO Notes` (App/Internal modes already isolate via the `.dev`
  applicationId). → [Data safety](#data-safety)

> **Gap:** Android pre-11 (API < 30) devices can't use Device storage (All-files
> access is an API-30 mechanism) — they only get App storage, so their vault is
> not visible in a file manager. _(Android)_

> **Gap:** The vault folder is fixed per mode and not a user-pickable arbitrary
> directory on mobile (desktop allows a custom folder); iOS has no iCloud Drive
> vault option. Both are possible follow-ups. _(iOS / Android)_

## Where logic lives

- Note CRUD, rules, sync, search, and indexing logic live in Rust
  (`crates/futo-notes-*`), exposed **once** via the `futo-notes-ffi` UniFFI
  facade (iOS/Android) and `#[tauri::command]`s (desktop). Svelte / Compose /
  SwiftUI are thin shells that call in and render. →
  AGENTS.md → "Where Logic Lives"
- Deterministic editor rules (filename/tag parsing) may keep a synchronous TS
  copy in `packages/editor` to avoid a per-keystroke IPC/FFI hop, but it is
  conformance-locked bit-for-bit against the Rust impl. → tests/conformance
- The Tauri desktop Rust shell is a named adapter, not another domain layer.
  Its final module names, ownership boundaries, stable command/event surface,
  compatibility commands, watcher suppression, and inline-test convention are
  specified in [desktop-rust.md](desktop-rust.md).
- The frontend Tauri platform boundary is owned by `src/lib/platform/tauri/`:
  `adapter.ts` owns construction plus notes-root and watcher lifecycle state;
  `storage.ts` owns non-note filesystem I/O; `images.ts` owns image persistence,
  URL policy, and capability state; clipboard access is part of `PlatformFS`;
  the remaining capability files own config/root policies; and
  `src/lib/platform/tauri.ts` is only the stable public composition facade.

## Performance

- Book-length notes must stay responsive. On the open path an unbounded
  synchronous full-document parse (`ensureSyntaxTree(..., doc.length, 5000)`) is
  banned; instead the `LiveMarkdownPlugin` constructor seeds decorations with a
  tightly time-boxed (≤200 ms) `ensureSyntaxTree(..., doc.length, 200)` parse,
  then grows decorations incrementally as parsing continues
  (`scheduleParseRefresh`). → src/features/editor/live-preview/LiveMarkdownPlugin.ts,
  docs/learnings/scroll-fix-handoff-report.md

## Data safety

- Dev/debug builds must never overwrite the production app or notes: a distinct
  bundle id (`com.futo.notes.dev`) and a distinct notes root
  (`~/Documents/fake-notes` on desktop). → CLAUDE.md,
  `apps/tauri/src-tauri/src/vault_location.rs`
- Production native mobile builds use the production package/bundle id
  `com.futo.notes`; native debug builds use `com.futo.notes.dev` so local
  installs keep separate app data and credentials.

## Soft keyboard _(Android)_

- Dismissing the soft keyboard by the system back gesture/button drops the
  focused field's caret, app-wide — Android hides the IME without clearing
  focus, and a caret with no keyboard has no function (#24). The drop is
  INSTANT: it keys off `imeAnimationTarget` (the hide animation's START),
  not the live IME inset (its end) — waiting out the slide-down reads as
  lag. The root `ClearFocusOnImeDismiss` covers every screen in the
  Activity window, and its `onDismiss` hook blurs the editor WebView over
  the bridge (its DOM caret survives a view-level clearFocus — see
  [editor.md](editor.md)); a dialog hosting a text field installs its own
  (a Dialog is its own window). → ui/components/ImeDismiss.kt,
  MainActivity.kt, NewFolderDialog.kt, CrashReportDialog.kt,
  EditorImeDismissBlurTest.kt
- iOS can't hit this: hiding the keyboard means resigning first responder,
  which drops the caret with it — the two are coupled on iOS, and the editor's
  only dismiss affordance (the toolbar chevron) blurs over the bridge.

## Dialogs _(desktop)_

- `window.confirm()` / `window.alert()` don't block in Tauri's webview — use
  `ask()` / `message()` from `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog`. → CLAUDE.md
- Confirmation prompts go through `confirmDialog()` (`src/shared/dialogs/confirmDialog.ts`):
  `ask()` under Tauri, `window.confirm()` in the plain web shell (dev server,
  Playwright) where plugin-dialog has no backend and would reject. → confirmDialog.ts

## Updates _(desktop self-update)_

- On launch (and then hourly), desktop builds that can self-update silently
  check the updater endpoint. A found update raises a small floating banner
  (bottom-right, above the sync status bar): a single **Update & restart**
  button — clicking anywhere on it downloads + verifies (minisign) + installs
  (showing a progress bar), then relaunches into the new version.
  → UpdateBanner.svelte, updateChecker.svelte.ts
- The launch/hourly checks are **silent**: a failed check (e.g. offline) never
  shows the banner or an error, and "you're already up to date" shows nothing.
  Only a user-initiated check (Settings → Updates) surfaces those outcomes; an
  install the user started from the banner surfaces its own error with a Retry.
- The banner has no dismiss control: it stays until the update is installed,
  the release is retracted, or updates are disabled in Settings.
  → UpdateBanner.svelte test "has no dismiss control"
- The banner and the Settings → Updates button share one state machine
  (`updateChecker`) — same pending version, progress, and install path — so a
  check or install from either is reflected in the other. The checker is
  started from App.svelte's background init and never gates render; it no-ops
  where self-update isn't possible (mobile/web, deb/rpm). → updates in
  settings.md, App.svelte, `apps/tauri/src-tauri/src/updater_commands.rs`

## Feedback & crash reporting

- Action feedback uses transient toasts (~3 s, one at a time, auto-dismiss):
  "Note deleted", "Moved to {folder}", "Path copied", etc. _(Tauri; Android
  native shows the same platform toasts — delete now toasts "Note deleted" from
  both the editor ⋮ menu and the list long-press)_ → shared/notifications/toastBus.ts,
  NoteEditorScreen.kt, NoteListScreen.kt
- Android emits delete/move success feedback only after the Rust store returns
  a committed mutation. A failed action instead reports that the note remains
  in place; it never navigates away from the editor or dismisses the move
  picker as though the mutation succeeded. → `NoteMutationOutcome`,
  `shouldCompleteNoteAction`, NoteActionCompletionTest
- An uncaught error/crash is queued; the **next launch** shows a Crash Report
  dialog: expandable "View report", an optional "What were you doing?" field,
  an "Always send crash reports" checkbox, and Send / Don't Send. "Always
  send" (also a Settings toggle) auto-sends future reports without the
  dialog. Rust-side panics persist the same schema under `.crashlogs` before
  the next-launch scan. → CrashReportDialog.svelte, crashHandler.ts,
  `apps/tauri/src-tauri/src/panic_reporter.rs` _(Tauri)_
- The native shells run the same pipeline: an uncaught-exception handler
  (Android `Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler`; iOS
  `NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler` plus fatal-signal handlers with
  pre-rendered, write-only signal paths) persists a desktop-schema JSON
  report to `<vault>/.crashlogs/` on the way down; the next launch scans the
  folder in the background (never gating render) and shows the same dialog,
  honoring the Settings toggle and Always-send; Send POSTs to the crash
  collector (`/api/crashes` batch, `/api/crash` fallback; dev builds target
  the local collector) and deletes the files. Verified end-to-end on
  emulator + simulator 2026-06-09 (test crash → relaunch dialog → collector
  received the POST → files cleared). → CrashReporter.kt +
  CrashReportDialog.kt _(Android)_, CrashReporter.swift _(iOS)_
